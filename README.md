Menu-Driven Program in C

Project Overview
This project is a menu-driven application written in C that allows users to perform multiple operations through a single interactive interface. The program repeatedly displays a menu, accepts user input, and executes the selected operation until the user chooses to exit.

* This project was developed as part of an academic C programming assignment to practice fundamental programming concepts and structured problem-solving.

Features:
* Reverse a five-digit number
* Print alphabet patterns
* Display all prime numbers from 1 to 100
* Multiply two 3×3 matrices
* Find the transpose of a 3×3 matrix
* Check whether a 3×3 matrix is symmetric
* Check whether a string is a palindrome
* Convert lowercase characters of a string to uppercase

Language: C

Concepts Applied:
* Loops (for, while, do-while)
* switch-case statements
* Arrays and matrices
* String handling
* Conditional logic

Learning Outcomes : 

Improved understanding of control flow and decision-making in C

Hands-on experience with matrix and string operations

Better knowledge of menu-driven program design

Strengthened problem-solving and logical thinking skills
